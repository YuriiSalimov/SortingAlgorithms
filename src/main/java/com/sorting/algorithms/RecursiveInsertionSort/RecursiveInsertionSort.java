/**
 * Recursive Insertion Sort
 * <p>
 * Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way
 * we sort playing cards in our hands.
 * Below is an iterative algorithm for insertion sort
 * Algorithm
 * Sort an arr[] of size n
 * insertionSort(arr, n)
 * Loop from i = 1 to n-1.
 * a) Pick element arr[i] and insert it into sorted sequence arr[0..i-1]
 * <p>
 * Recursive Insertion Sort has no performance/implementation advantages,
 * but can be a good question to check oneâ€™s understanding of Insertion Sort
 * and recursion. If we take a closer look at Insertion Sort algorithm,
 * we keep processed elements sorted and insert new elements one by one
 * in the inserted array.
 * <p>
 * Recursion Idea.
 * 1. Base Case: If array size is 1 or smaller, return.
 * 2. Recursively sort first n-1 elements.
 * 3. Insert last element at its correct position in sorted array.
 * <p>
