/**
 * ShellSort    O(n^2)
 * *
 * ShellSort is mainly a variation of Insertion Sort.
 * In insertion sort, we move elements only one position ahead.
 * When an element has to be moved far ahead, many movements are
 * involved. The idea of shellSort is to allow exchange of far
 * items. In shellSort, we make the array h-sorted for a large
 * value of h. We keep reducing the value of h until it becomes 1.
 * An array is said to be h-sorted if all sublists of every hâ€™th
 * element is sorted.
 * *
 * Time Complexity:
 * Time complexity of above implementation of shellsort is O(n^2).
 * In the above implementation gap is reduce by half in every iteration.
 * There are many other ways to reduce gap which lead to better time
 * complexity. See this for more details.
